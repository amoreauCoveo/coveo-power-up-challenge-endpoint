        <div>This page covers the available features of this site.</div>
        <h2>Movies and Directors</h2>
        <h3>Movies Listing API</h3>
        <div>Movies can be listed by calling the <code>/movies</code> endpoint.</div>
        <div>The endpoint shows the top 1,000 movies where English is one of the languages spoken.</div>
        <div>By default, calling the endpoint returns the first 20 results. The results are ordered by the number of votes multiplied by the average vote. This generally means that the most popular and liked movies are shown first.</div>
        <div>You can change the page by appending <code>?page=n</code> to your endpoint, where <code>n</code> is the page you want to fetch.</div>
        <div>You can also append <code>?per_page</code> to the endpoint to get fewer results per request. The maximum (and default) value is 20.</div>
        <div>For example, you can call <code>/movies?page=3&per_page=10</code>, which would give you the results 21 to 30.</div>
        <div>Some movies have their French name and description available. You can get them by adding <code>?lang=fr</code> to the request.</div>
        <div>For example, calling <code>/movies?lang=fr&page=3&per_page=10</code> returns results 21 to 30 of the movies in French.</div>
        <h3>Movie Details API</h3>
        <div>You can call the <code>/movies/movieid</code> endpoint, where <code>movieid</code> is replaced by a valid movie id, to get more information about a movie.</div>
        <div>For example, calling <code>/movies/tt0468569</code> will give you more information on the movie The Dark Knight.</div>
        <h3>Directors Listing API</h3>
        <div>Movies can be listed by calling the <code>/directors</code> endpoint.</div>
        <div>The endpoint shows all directors for the top 1,000 movies. The directors are not ordered in any particular way.</div>
        <div>By default, calling the endpoint returns the first 20 results.</div>
        <div>You can change the page by appending <code>?page=n</code> to your endpoint, where <code>n</code> is the page you want to fetch.</div>
        <div>You can also append <code>?per_page</code> to the endpoint to get fewer results per request. The maximum (and default) value is 20.</div>
        <div>For example, you can call <code>/directors?page=3&per_page=10</code>, which would give you the results 21 to 30.</div>
        <h3>Director Details API</h3>
        <div>You can call the <code>/directors/directorid</code> endpoint, where <code>directorid</code> is replaced by a valid director id.</div>
        <div>For example, calling <code>/directors/nm0634240</code> will give you details about Christopher Nolan.</div>
        <div>Importantly, calling the director details endpoint always returns an array. That is because you can call multiple directors at once, separated by semi-colons(<code>;</code>).</div>
        <div>For example, calling <code>/directors/nm0905154;nm0905152</code> returns both Wachowski's.</div>
        <h2>Pokémon</h2>
        <h3>Pokémon Listing API</h3>
        <div>Pokémon can be listed by calling the <code>/pokemon</code> endpoint.</div>
        <div>The endpoint shows all Pokémon from Generations 1 to 8. It does not contain alternate forms (such as Alolan/Galar forms or Mega Evolutions).</div>
        <div>By default, calling the endpoint returns the first 20 results. The results are ordered by National Pokédex number.</div>
        <div>You can change the page by appending <code>?page=n</code> to your endpoint, where <code>n</code> is the page you want to fetch.</div>
        <div>You can also append <code>?per_page</code> to the endpoint to get fewer results per request. The maximum (and default) value is 20.</div>
